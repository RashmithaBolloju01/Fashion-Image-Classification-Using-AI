# Fashion Image Classification Using AI

Fashion Image Classification Using AI is a deep learning project that categorizes clothing images into predefined fashion classes. Built using image-based data and a custom neural network, it highlights the application of artificial intelligence in the fashion retail and recommendation space.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify grayscale fashion images (such as shirts, shoes, and bags) into their respective categories using supervised learning. The implementation is performed entirely in a Jupyter Notebook, using a structured .csv dataset and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature learning.

# Features

Image classification using deep learning
Multi-class prediction for common fashion items
Visual insights into model performance and learning curves
Simple and scalable training pipeline using NumPy and TensorFlow
Clean, well-commented Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility

# Technologies Used

Category	Tools and Libraries
Language	Python
Deep Learning	TensorFlow / Keras
Data Handling	NumPy, Pandas
Visualization	Matplotlib, Seaborn
Notebook	Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Dataset Format	CSV (Pixel values per image)

# How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fashion-Image-Classification-Using-AI.git
cd Fashion-Image-Classification-Using-AI
Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook "fashion image.ipynb"
Run the cells to train and test the model.
Ensure all dependencies (TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, etc.) are installed in your environment before execution.

# Sample Use Case

A retail platform or AI-powered app classifies user-submitted clothing photos into categories like sneakers, t-shirts, or handbags. This enables better search filtering, inventory management, or personalized style recommendations.

# Future Enhancements

Switch to image file datasets (e.g., .png or .jpg) for visual debugging
Apply data augmentation to reduce overfitting
Visualize filters and feature maps from hidden layers
Deploy as an interactive demo using Streamlit or Flask
