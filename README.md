# Fashion-Image-Classification-Using-AI

This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify fashion items from images. The objective is to build a robust AI model that can automatically identify various types of fashion items such as clothing, shoes, and accessories, based on images uploaded by users. This can serve as a foundation for building personalized shopping recommendations or trend analysis systems.
